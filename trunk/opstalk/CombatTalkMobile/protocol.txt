We have A,B,C,D, 4 devices (including server)

for device A:

a hashMap of transTime

<A, ta> <B, tb> <C, tc> <D, td>

ta transTime is the time up to when the A has receive data from.

The transTime is the time when A send the event to other device. 
So, When A sends events to other device,it must send by the order of transTime of these events. 

When A connected to B, A send tb to B, so that B will only send to A the
events whose transTime is later than tb.
